# Stress-Detection-from-Textual-Data-using-NLP-and-Naive-Bayes-Classifier

HI There !!! 
My name is Mohammed Imaduddin. This project is a part of my journey to breaking into AI/ML and becoming a Data-Scientist.

DESCRIPTION:

This project is focused on building a machine learning model that can predict whether a text is written by someone who is under stress or not. The project consists of several steps, including data cleaning and preprocessing, text visualization, feature extraction, model building, and prediction.

The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing two columns: "text" and "label." The "text" column contains the text data, while the "label" column specifies whether the text is written by a stressed author (1) or not (0). The first step in the project is to load the data into a pandas DataFrame and perform some basic exploratory data analysis, such as checking for missing values and generating statistics for the numerical columns.

The next step is to clean the text data and preprocess it for feature extraction. The cleaning process involves converting all text to lowercase, removing URLs and HTML tags, eliminating punctuation, removing stop words, and applying stemming to reduce words to their root forms. The cleaned text is then visualized using a word cloud, which displays the most commonly occurring words in the text data.

The third step involves feature extraction, which is done using CountVectorizer, a tool that transforms text data into numerical features by counting the occurrences of words. The resulting numerical features are then split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from sklearn.

The final step in the project is model building and prediction. A Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier is used to train a model on the training data and predict the labels for the testing data. The user can input their own text, which is then cleaned and processed using the same preprocessing techniques as the training data. The resulting features are then fed into the trained model, and the predicted label (stressed or not stressed) is output to the user.

Overall, this project provides a practical example of how to build a machine learning model for text classification using Python and several popular libraries such as pandas, nltk, sklearn, and wordcloud.

IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE DONE:

1. Data collection: The dataset used in this project seems to be relatively small, with only 1050 rows of data. Collecting a larger dataset could improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.

2. Data preprocessing: While the data is cleaned in the code, there may be additional steps that could improve the quality of the data for modeling. For example, removing stop words may not always be beneficial depending on the context, and additional cleaning steps such as removing URLs or punctuation could be added.

3. Feature engineering: The current model only uses a Bag-of-Words approach to represent the text data, which does not capture the semantic meaning of the words. Adding additional features such as word embeddings or topic modeling could improve the performance of the model.

4. Model selection: While the current model uses Naive Bayes, there are other models that could potentially perform better on this task, such as Support Vector Machines or Neural Networks. Trying out different models and comparing their performance could improve the accuracy of the model.

5. Model evaluation: The current model is only evaluated on its accuracy, which may not always be the most informative metric. Adding additional evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score could provide a more complete picture of the model's performance.

6. Deployment: While the current code allows for inputting a single text and predicting its stress level, it could be improved by creating a user interface and deploying it as a web application or mobile app for wider use. This would require additional development skills and resources, but could greatly increase the impact of the project.


RESULTS:

This model is giving pretty accurate results (i.e. of telling weather the person writing the text is in stress or not ) give our dataset, however this can be improved upto a great extent by increasing our Data set and advanced model selection.
